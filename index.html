A Timeline of Recent Search Engine Events
(Or as My Father Would Put it, Where Did My Google Go?)

by Kenova Ceredo - kenova.ceredo@protonmail.com

What follows is a timeline of events that
is factual to the best of my knowledge. The
timeline itself contains no opinions, although
there may be some in the conclusion. Most of
the events happened in late 2015 and 2016, but
there are also some details about the end of
the Gigablast search engine, which happened
a couple of years later. A few of these events
are very obscure, even though they may have
had a large impact. I hope you enjoy reading
it, and perhaps learn something new. By the
way, if you find any of this interesting, you are
allowed to take a picture, scan, or screenshot
of this article and share it willy-nilly around
the Internet, or as a facsimile transmission on
the HF bands. 2600 Magazine is okay with
that too, because they printed this permission
notice. If, however, you don’t find it interesting,
you aren’t even allowed to read it aloud to other
people, and you are encouraged to forget about
it completely.

2015 - 2016

July 1, 2015: The company behind the
Gigablast search engine announces that
they have entered a partnership with the
Internet Archive, and are going to use their
technology to index the Internet Archive’s
vast collection of archived web pages. At
the time, the Internet Archive had about 485
billion pages in its collection, and the plan
was to index it in order to make “the biggest
search engine ever created.” (web.archive.org/web/20151113002432/http://www.gigablast.com:80/blog.html)

Sometime between November 13th and 26th,
2015: Gigablast removes their announcement
about the Internet Archive from their blog
page. As far as I can tell, the Internet Archive
never made an announcement about the
agreement. There is no more news about this,
and apparently “the biggest search engine ever
created” is canceled. (web.archive.org/web/20151126032955/http://gigablast.com:80/blog.html)

February 2016: Google decides to phase
out the “Google Search Appliance” product,
which was essentially server hardware running
Google’s software that allowed the owner
to index and search though large document
collections: The largest model could store and
index up to 100 million documents.

Sometime in early 2016: Google starts
limiting all searches to about 400 results, which
is about 40 pages. Before this, the limit was about
700 results, and a while before that it was about
1000 results. This is according to anecdotal
evidence from a “Diamond Product Expert”
on support.google.com. (support.google.com/websearch/thread/25885806/header-indicates-thousands-of-results-but-only-110-are-shown)

As of early 2025, all search engines that I
know of limit the number of results that you
can see. Some engines like Bing and Mojeek
deliver about 1000 results before stopping
the user from seeing more, but most of them
deliver a lot less. Brave Search, for example,
only delivers about nine or ten pages, which
translates to about 170 results. Mwmbl.org (a
small project with only about 600 million pages
in its index) only returns about 80 results. To be
clear, these are limits that stay in effect for very
broad searches, like “cheese” and “pancake”.
Unfortunately, I don’t have any dates for when
the limitations on search engines other than
Google started.

February 6, 2016: All Seeks nodes become
unusable. Seeks was an open source meta-
search engine that re-ranked results based on
user activity.

April 2016: Microsoft starts to open source
BitFunnel, which seems to at least be a large
part of, but might actually be the entirety of,
their indexing system for the Bing search
engine.

April 2016: Sylvain Zimmer starts the
Common Search project that was to mainly
use Common Crawl data in its index.
Some ranking data from this project was
used by Common Crawl (mentioned in
this post: commoncrawl.org/blog/august-2016-crawl-archive-now-available), 
and Greg Lindahl (who is
now CTO of Common Crawl, but didn’t appear
to be at the time) was listed as an advisor.
There are a couple of small search engine
projects still running today that use Common
Crawl data: alexandria.org and chatnoir.eu, but
the latter only uses two crawls from Common
Crawl, and the former appears to draw from
a similarly small index. 

Two crawls is a tiny
fraction of what Common Crawl has available.
I do not know if the plan was for Common
Search to use the entirety of the available
Common Crawl data, but if they had, and if
they were still running today, they would have
about 250 billion indexed pages, which would
put them in the same league as Google and
Bing. Some of the pages from commonsearch.
org are available on the Internet Archive, but
a more complete and current archive of the
site is available on Github: github.com/commonsearch/cosr-about/tree/master/content .

August 2016: The last blog post for Common
Search is posted. No more work is done on
the search engine past this point. There is
currently no mention of it on the founder’s
website (sylvainzimmer.com/).

October 2016: Microsoft appears to abandon
work on open sourcing BitFunnel. No more
blog posts are made about their progress past
this point, even though no official statement
has been made about canceling the project. A
paper about BitFunnel is published in August
2017, but it does not appear that any work is
resumed on the project. (bitfunnel.org/)

End of Gigablast, 2018 - 2023

January 2018: gigablast.com/faq.html is
replaced with a blank page. Before it was
blank, the page detailed some features and
technical specifications of the search engine,
and explained how to install the Gigablast
software on your own computer and get it up
and running, in order to have a local instance of
the search engine with a personally constructed
index. If you visit an archived version of the
page on the Internet Archive, you can actually
still download and install the linked Gigablast
binaries, because they were archived as well. I
have tested the Debian/Ubuntu 64-bit version,
and it seems to work well except that it doesn’t
support SSL, so any pages that require HTTPS
will not be crawled. I have been told however
that the original version of Gigablast ran
behind an Apache2 reverse proxy, which took
care of SSL. I have not attempted to set up such
a system myself, but it may be a fun project for
the interested reader.

Sometime between February 26 and March
9, 2022: A small message is placed at the top of
the Gigablast home page and blog page, which
consists of the words “Fuck all dictators!”
beneath the United States flag. Sometime
between March 19 and March 23, the words
change to “No more dictators!” Sometime
between April 6 and April 28, the flag goes
away and the words are replaced with “sudo rm
-rf /dictators”. Sometime between September
11 and October 30, 2022, the message
disappears and doesn’t come back. I am not
sure why these messages were put here, but
perhaps they can fuel my readers’ speculations
as to why Gigablast eventually went offline.

Early April 2023: gigablast.com goes
offline completely and permanently with no
announcement.

I don’t know why most of these things
happened. I don’t know why many happened
around 2016, or if that is just a coincidence.
I don’t know if any of these people ran into
technical issues, or legal issues, or what. All
of the outcomes of these events concern me
however, and I would like to know more about
all of them.

If you have any comments, facts, theories,
hints, tidbits, stories, insights, or anything
that seems remotely related to this subject and
might be slightly interesting, I want to know
about it. Heck, even if it seems unrelated and
boring, but this article reminded you of it,
let me know. Please contact me at the email
address specified under the title of this article,
or let the whole 2600 community know about
it by sending a letter to the editor. Or do both.
You can use an anonymous remailer (if you
trust any of them) if you are concerned about
identity.

Anyway, I hope I added to your knowledge,
and I hope you’re healthy and having a great
time. I feel an urge to toss around vague
statements, so I’ll say this: Sooner or later,
somebody needs to do something that makes
stuff happen. Maybe a lot of people need to
do stuff before something actually succeeds.
Maybe one of those people could be you. If you
try anything, I’d like to hear about it.
